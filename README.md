## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- A Mistral API key ([Get one here](https://console.mistral.ai/))

### One-Click Setup & Run (Windows)

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Auto-Image-Caption.git
   cd Auto-Image-Caption
   ```

2. **Set up your API key:**
   
   Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Open `.env` and add your Mistral API key:
   ```env
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   MISTRAL_MODEL=mistral-small-latest
   IMAGE_FOLDER=C:/path/to/your/images
   ```

3. **Install dependencies & run:**
   
   Just double-click `run.bat` - it handles everything! 🎉
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

That's it! Your images will be processed, descriptions will be embedded, and everything will be logged. ☕

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Image Discovery** - Scans the `images/` folder for supported file types
2. **AI Processing** - Sends each image to Mistral Vision API for analysis
3. **Description Generation** - Receives detailed, natural-language descriptions
4. **Metadata Embedding** - Embeds descriptions into image metadata
5. **Logging** - Saves a timestamped log of all operations to `logs/` folder

All output is displayed in your terminal **and** saved to log files for future reference!

---

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Process Images
```bash
python main.py
```

### Check Metadata
Verify that descriptions were successfully embedded:
```bash
python check_metadata.py
```

### View Logs
All logs are saved in `logs/` folder with timestamps:
```
logs/
├── image_processing_20251224_202033.txt
├── image_processing_20251224_203145.txt
└── ...
```

## 🔧 Configuration

All configuration is done through the `.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MISTRAL_API_KEY` | Your Mistral API key (required) | `IK1E2yeSqM8cYA0mHw...` |
| `MISTRAL_MODEL` | Mistral model to use | `mistral-small-latest` |
| `IMAGE_FOLDER` | Path to your images folder | `C:/Users/you/Pictures` |
| `MISTRAL_IMAGE_MAX_SIDE` | Downscale images before upload to reduce rate limiting / token usage | `1024` |
| `MISTRAL_IMAGE_QUALITY` | JPEG quality used after resizing (higher = bigger payload) | `85` |
| `MISTRAL_MAX_RETRIES` | How many times to retry on HTTP 429 (rate limited) per image | `3` |
| `MISTRAL_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS` | Base delay (seconds) before retrying after 429 | `2` |
| `MISTRAL_MIN_SECONDS_BETWEEN_REQUESTS` | Optional throttle between requests to be nice to the API | `0` |

The `logs/` folder location is hardcoded to the project directory and created automatically at runtime.

## 🖼️ Supported Image Formats

| Format | Extension | Metadata Method |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **JPEG** | `.jpg`, `.jpeg` | EXIF tag 270 (ImageDescription) |
| **PNG** | `.png` | PNG text chunks |
| **WebP** | `.webp` | EXIF metadata |
| **Others** | Any | Sidecar `.txt` files |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "MISTRAL_API_KEY not found in environment variables"
→ Make sure you've created a `.env` file and added your API key.

### "No images found in folder"
→ Check that your `IMAGE_FOLDER` path in `.env` is correct and contains supported image formats.

### Images not getting descriptions
→ Verify your Mistral API key is valid and has credits remaining.

### HTTP 429 (Rate limit exceeded)
→ This usually happens when image payloads are large or requests are sent too quickly. This app downsizes/compresses images before upload; if you still see 429, lower `MISTRAL_IMAGE_MAX_SIDE` / `MISTRAL_IMAGE_QUALITY` and increase `MISTRAL_MAX_RETRIES` / `MISTRAL_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`.
